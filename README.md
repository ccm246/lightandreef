Assessing the influence of light pollution and associated risks on coral reefs

C.R. Miller, E.K. Fobert, and A.N. Rice

Coral reefs around the world are impacted by an increasing variety and intensity of anthropogenic disturbances. Ocean warming, chemical pollution, noise pollution and physical degradation are well known threats to reefs worldwide. However, the extent of the ecosystem-level threat of light pollution is less well understood, even as it continues to change in composition and expand further across the globe. While previous studies have documented effects of artificial light at night (ALAN) on coral reef systems, the interacting effects of compounding potential stressors remain unknown. Using publicly available data on the global extent of coral reefs and ALAN spatial data, we assess how many reef systems could be affected by the expansion of ALAN into ocean systems. We show that 14% of reefs in the Northern Caribbean are likely exposed to ALAN including some mesophotic reefs. We additionally investigate the role of marine ALAN as a cumulative threat to reef ecosystems, including increased water temperature and sound pollution, to quantify how multiple anthropogenic threats predict reef bleaching risk. The broad geographical extent of increased ALAN exposure that we demonstrate here highlights the urgency of establishing a better understanding of impacts on these habitats and the need to implement mitigation strategies.
